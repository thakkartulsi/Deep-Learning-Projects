**How It Works as a Whole**
1. Loads the VGG19 model when the app starts.
2. Accepts an image upload from the user.
3. Preprocesses the uploaded image.
4. Passes the preprocessed image to the model for prediction.
5. Displays the top 3 predictions, along with their confidence scores, in the Streamlit app.
